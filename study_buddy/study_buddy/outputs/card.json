{"flascard_dict":{"Beginner":[{"section":"Introduction","question":"What is Bitcoin?","answer":"Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments to anyone, anywhere in the world."},{"section":"Introduction","question":"Who created Bitcoin?","answer":"Bitcoin was created by an unknown person or group of people using the name Satoshi Nakamoto."},{"section":"Introduction","question":"How many Bitcoins are there?","answer":"There are a finite number of Bitcoins: 21 million."},{"section":"Transactions","question":"What is a Bitcoin transaction?","answer":"A Bitcoin transaction is a transfer of value between Bitcoin wallets that gets included in the blockchain."},{"section":"Transactions","question":"How are Bitcoin transactions verified?","answer":"Bitcoin transactions are verified by network nodes through cryptography and recorded in a public distributed ledger called a blockchain."}],"Intermediate":[{"section":"Timestamp Server","question":"How does the timestamp server work?","answer":"The timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash, such as in a newspaper or Usenet post."},{"section":"Proof-of-Work","question":"What is proof-of-work?","answer":"Proof-of-work is a system that involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits."},{"section":"Network","question":"How does the Bitcoin network operate?","answer":"New transactions are broadcast to all nodes. Each node collects new transactions into a block. Each node works on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block. When a node finds a proof-of-work, it broadcasts the block to all nodes. Nodes accept the block only if all transactions in it are valid and not already spent. Nodes express their acceptance of the block by working on creating the next block in the chain, using the hash of the accepted block as the previous hash."},{"section":"Incentive","question":"What is the incentive for nodes to support the network?","answer":"The incentive for nodes to support the network is the creation of new coins, which are added to the blockchain by the creator of the block."},{"section":"Reclaiming Disk Space","question":"How is disk space reclaimed in the Bitcoin network?","answer":"Once the latest transaction in a coin is buried under enough blocks, the spent transactions before it can be discarded to save disk space. Transactions are hashed in a Merkle Tree, with only the root included in the block's hash. Old blocks can then be compacted by stubbing off branches of the tree."}],"Advanced":[{"section":"Simplified Payment Verification","question":"How can payments be verified without running a full network node?","answer":"A user only needs to keep a copy of the block headers of the longest proof-of-work chain, which he can get by querying network nodes until he's convinced he has the longest chain, and obtain the Merkle branch linking the transaction to the block it's timestamped in."},{"section":"Combining and Splitting Value","question":"How are multiple inputs and outputs used in Bitcoin transactions?","answer":"To allow value to be split and combined, transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs. Normally there will be either a single input from a larger previous transaction or multiple inputs combining smaller amounts, and at most two outputs: one for the payment, and one returning the change, if any, back to the sender."},{"section":"Privacy","question":"How is privacy maintained in Bitcoin transactions?","answer":"Privacy is maintained by keeping public keys anonymous. The public can see that someone is sending an amount to someone else, but without information linking the transaction to anyone."},{"section":"Calculations","question":"What happens if an attacker tries to generate an alternate chain faster than the honest chain?","answer":"Even if this is accomplished, it does not throw the system open to arbitrary changes, such as creating value out of thin air or taking money that never belonged to the attacker. Nodes are not going to accept an invalid transaction as payment, and honest nodes will never accept a block containing them. An attacker can only try to change one of his own transactions to take back money he recently spent."},{"section":"Conclusion","question":"What is the proposed system for electronic transactions without relying on trust?","answer":"The proposed system is a peer-to-peer network using proof-of-work to record a public history of transactions that quickly becomes computationally impractical for an attacker to change if honest nodes control a majority of CPU power."}]}}
