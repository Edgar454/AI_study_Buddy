Java is an object-oriented programming language that supports concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. The Java Development Kit (JDK) is used to develop Java applications, and setting up the Java environment involves downloading and installing the JDK, setting the JAVA\_HOME environment variable, and adding the JDK bin directory to the system PATH. Creating a Java program involves creating a Java source file with a main method, compiling the source file using the javac command, and running the resulting bytecode using the java command. Java classes and objects are used to create instances of objects, while inheritance and polymorphism promote code reuse and make code more flexible. Encapsulation promotes data hiding and makes code more secure.
