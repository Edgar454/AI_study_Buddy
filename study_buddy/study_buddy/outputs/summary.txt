Bitcoin is a decentralized digital currency that enables instant payments without intermediaries like banks. Created in 2009 by Satoshi Nakamoto, it operates on a technology called the blockchain, a public, distributed ledger that records transactions. Bitcoin transactions are made directly from person to person and are verified by network nodes through cryptography. The blockchain is a timestamped ledger, with each block containing a link to the previous block, creating an unbreakable chain of records. Bitcoin miners compete to solve complex mathematical problems to add the next block of transactions to the blockchain and are rewarded with newly created Bitcoins. The Bitcoin network is a global consensus of interconnected computers, and miners are incentivized to participate through block rewards and transaction fees. Bitcoin transactions can involve multiple inputs and outputs, allowing users to combine or split funds. While the blockchain is public, user identities are linked to public keys, offering a level of privacy. The proof-of-work mechanism and the decentralized nature of the Bitcoin network prevent double-spending. Bitcoin represents a paradigm shift in finance, offering a decentralized, secure, and transparent alternative to traditional systems.
