Introduction
------------

The study material provided is an introduction to Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) in Java. Java is a programming language created by James Gosling and presented officially in 1995. It is used in various types of applications such as mobile applications (Android), desktop applications, web applications, and enterprise applications. Java applications are compiled into an intermediate code called bytecode that can run on any machine with a Java Virtual Machine (JVM).

Java is an object-oriented programming language that supports concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. It is a multi-platform language, meaning that the same code can run on different platforms without modification. Java is also an open-source language, which means that its source code is available for developers to modify and improve.

Java Development Kit (JDK)
--------------------------

The Java Development Kit (JDK) is a software development environment used to develop Java applications. It includes various tools such as the Java compiler (javac), the Java interpreter (java), and the Java documentation generator (javadoc). The JDK also includes the Java Runtime Environment (JRE), which is used to run Java applications.

Setting up the Java Environment
-------------------------------

To set up the Java environment, the user needs to download and install the JDK from the Oracle website. After installation, the user needs to set the JAVA\_HOME environment variable to the path of the JDK installation directory. The user also needs to add the JDK bin directory to the system PATH environment variable.

Creating a Java Program
-----------------------

To create a Java program, the user needs to create a Java source file with a .java extension. The source file should contain a public class with a main method. The main method is the entry point of the program. The user can then compile the source file using the javac command and run the resulting bytecode using the java command.

Java Classes and Objects
------------------------

In Java, a class is a blueprint for creating objects. An object is an instance of a class. A class can contain variables and methods. Variables are used to store data, while methods are used to perform operations on the data.

Java Inheritance
----------------

Inheritance is a mechanism in Java that allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class. The class that inherits properties and methods is called the subclass, while the class that provides the properties and methods is called the superclass. Inheritance allows for code reuse and promotes modularity.

Java Polymorphism
-----------------

Polymorphism is a mechanism in Java that allows objects of different classes to be treated as objects of a common superclass. This means that a single method call can be used to invoke different methods depending on the type of object being used. Polymorphism promotes code reuse and makes code more flexible.

Java Encapsulation
------------------

Encapsulation is a mechanism in Java that allows data and methods to be bundled together in a single unit called a class. This means that the data and methods are hidden from other classes, and can only be accessed through the class's public interface. Encapsulation promotes data hiding and makes code more secure.

Conclusion
----------

In conclusion, Java is a powerful object-oriented programming language that supports various concepts such as classes, objects, inheritance, polymorphism, and encapsulation. The Java Development Kit (JDK) provides various tools for developing Java applications, and setting up the Java environment is straightforward. Creating a Java program involves creating a Java source file with a main method, compiling the source file using the javac command, and running the resulting bytecode using the java command. Java classes and objects are used to create instances of objects, while inheritance and polymorphism promote code reuse and make code more flexible. Encapsulation promotes data hiding and makes code more secure.
