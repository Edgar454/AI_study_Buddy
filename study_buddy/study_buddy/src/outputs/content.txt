Introduction:
The study material provided is a chapter on duality in linear optimization. Duality is a fundamental concept in optimization theory that allows for the transformation of a linear optimization problem into another problem that provides the same optimal solution. This chapter covers the definition of duality, the relationship between the primal and dual problems, and the use of duality in solving linear optimization problems.

Main Sections:

1. Definition of Duality:
The dual of a linear optimization problem is another problem that provides the same optimal solution as the original problem. The dual problem is obtained by taking the transpose of the constraint matrix and reversing the direction of the inequality constraints. The objective function of the dual problem is the negative of the objective function of the original problem.
2. Relationship between Primal and Dual Problems:
The primal and dual problems are related in several ways. The optimal value of the primal problem is always greater than or equal to the optimal value of the dual problem. If the optimal value of the primal problem is equal to the optimal value of the dual problem, then the optimal solution of the primal problem is also the optimal solution of the dual problem.
3. Use of Duality in Solving Linear Optimization Problems:
Duality can be used to solve linear optimization problems in several ways. One way is to solve the dual problem instead of the primal problem. This can be useful when the primal problem is difficult to solve directly. Another way is to use duality to obtain bounds on the optimal value of the primal problem. This can be useful when the primal problem is difficult to solve exactly.
