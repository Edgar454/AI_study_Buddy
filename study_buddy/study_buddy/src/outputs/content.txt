Introduction:
The study material focuses on the topic of Reconnaissance Automatique de l'Ecriture et du Document (RAED), which is a discipline that has taken a significant leap in recent years by becoming involved in various technological sectors. The discipline aims to bridge the gap between the performance of recognizing printed and handwritten documents, with the latter being more challenging. The interest in industrial handwritten applications such as postal sorting, check amount recognition, and form analysis has led to the strengthening of recognition methods, tackling increasingly difficult challenges such as unconstrained writing, large vocabulary usage, and multifont recognition.

Aspects Méthodologiques:
RAED proposes different approaches depending on the mode of writing, with the regularity of printed documents allowing for more reliable and faster techniques than those used for handwritten documents, which have a higher degree of complexity and variability. The study material organizes this section based on these two types of writing.

Reconnaissance de l'écriture manuscrite:
The study material classifies methods of recognition based on the mode of acquisition of writing. Online (or dynamic) writing is obtained through continuous input and presented as a sequence of points ordered in time. This mode of writing is often compared to speech recognition, with researchers frequently applying techniques from that field. Offline (or static) writing is obtained through the input of an existing text, either through a scanner or a camera. This mode of writing results in an image, either binary or grayscale, that has lost all temporal information about the order of points.

The study material also discusses the challenges of recognizing handwritten documents, including the difficulty of recognizing cursive writing with a large vocabulary. The study material presents a classification of the complexity of recognition problems based on several orthogonal criteria, including the spatial arrangement of text, the number of writers, and the size of the vocabulary.

Techniques de reconnaissance:
The study material presents several techniques for recognizing handwritten documents, including character recognition, word recognition, and line recognition. The study material also discusses the use of preprocessing techniques such as baseline correction, slant correction, skeletonization, and normalization to improve recognition accuracy.

Reconnaissance en ligne:
The study material discusses the use of online recognition techniques, which take into account the temporal information of the writing process. The study material presents several examples of online recognition techniques, including the use of hidden Markov models and recurrent neural networks.

Reconnaissance de documents:
The study material discusses the use of document recognition techniques, which aim to extract the structure and content of a document. The study material presents several examples of document recognition techniques, including the use of optical character recognition (OCR) and layout analysis.

Conclusion:
RAED is a rapidly evolving discipline that has the potential to revolutionize the way we interact with written documents. The study material provides a comprehensive overview of the current state of the art in RAED, including the challenges and opportunities associated with recognizing handwritten and printed documents. The study material also presents several examples of practical applications of RAED, demonstrating its potential impact on various industries.
