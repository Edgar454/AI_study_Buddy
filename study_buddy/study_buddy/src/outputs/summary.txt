Bitcoin: A Peer-to-Peer Electronic Cash System is a research paper by Satoshi Nakamoto that proposes a solution to the double-spending problem in digital cash transactions using a peer-to-peer network. The paper introduces the concept of a timestamp server and a proof-of-work system to implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis. The paper also discusses the incentive for nodes to support the network, the possibility of funding the incentive with transaction fees, and the possibility of reclaiming disk space by discarding spent transactions. The paper also proposes a system for simplified payment verification and maintaining privacy. The paper concludes by summarizing the proposed system and discussing its robustness in its unstructured simplicity.
