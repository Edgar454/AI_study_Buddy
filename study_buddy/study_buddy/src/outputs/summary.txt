Reconnaissance Automatique de l'Ecriture et du Document (RAED) is a discipline focused on bridging the gap between recognizing printed and handwritten documents. It employs different approaches for printed and handwritten text, with the latter being more complex due to variability in handwriting styles. Handwritten recognition methods are categorized into online (dynamic) and offline (static) recognition, with the former capturing the sequence of strokes in real-time and the latter analyzing static images. The complexity of recognition tasks varies based on factors such as spatial arrangement, number of writers, and vocabulary size. Various techniques and preprocessing steps are employed to enhance recognition accuracy, including character, word, and line recognition, as well as baseline correction, slant correction, skeletonization, and normalization. RAED is a rapidly evolving field with potential applications in various industries, from postal sorting to historical document analysis.
