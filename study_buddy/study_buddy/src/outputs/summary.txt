Duality in linear optimization is a fundamental concept that allows for the transformation of a linear optimization problem into another problem that provides the same optimal solution. The dual problem is obtained by taking the transpose of the constraint matrix and reversing the direction of the inequality constraints. The primal and dual problems are related in several ways, with the optimal value of the primal problem always greater than or equal to the optimal value of the dual problem. Duality can be used to solve linear optimization problems in several ways, such as solving the dual problem instead of the primal problem or using duality to obtain bounds on the optimal value of the primal problem. Duality can also be used to obtain sensitivity analysis of the optimal solution and can be extended to nonlinear optimization problems and used to solve integer programming problems.
