{"flascard_dict":{"Beginner":[{"section":"Introduction","recto":"What is the concept of a peer-to-peer electronic cash system?","verso":"A peer-to-peer electronic cash system allows online payments to be sent directly from one party to another without the need for a financial institution."},{"section":"Transactions","recto":"What is an electronic coin in the context of Bitcoin?","verso":"An electronic coin is a chain of digital signatures."},{"section":"Timestamp Server","recto":"What is the purpose of a timestamp server in Bitcoin?","verso":"The purpose of a timestamp server is to provide proof that the data existed at the time of the timestamp."},{"section":"Proof-of-Work","recto":"What is the proof-of-work system in Bitcoin?","verso":"The proof-of-work system involves scanning for a value that when hashed, such as with SHA-256, the hash begins with a number of zero bits."},{"section":"Network","recto":"What are the steps to run the Bitcoin network?","verso":"The steps to run the Bitcoin network include new transactions being broadcast to all nodes, each node collecting new transactions into a block, and each node working on finding a difficult proof-of-work for its block."},{"section":"Incentive","recto":"What is the incentive for nodes to support the Bitcoin network?","verso":"The incentive for nodes to support the Bitcoin network is the creation of new coins."},{"section":"Reclaiming Disk Space","recto":"How can old blocks be compacted in Bitcoin?","verso":"Old blocks can be compacted by stubbing off branches of the Merkle tree."},{"section":"Simplified Payment Verification","recto":"What is the purpose of simplified payment verification in Bitcoin?","verso":"The purpose of simplified payment verification is to allow a user to verify payments without running a full network node."},{"section":"Combining and Splitting Value","recto":"How can transactions contain multiple inputs and outputs in Bitcoin?","verso":"Transactions can contain multiple inputs and outputs to allow value to be split and combined."},{"section":"Privacy","recto":"How are public keys kept anonymous in Bitcoin?","verso":"Public keys are kept anonymous in Bitcoin by not linking them to a common owner."}],"Intermediate":[{"section":"Introduction","recto":"What is the problem of double-spending in digital cash transactions?","verso":"The problem of double-spending in digital cash transactions is the risk of a digital currency being spent more than once."},{"section":"Transactions","recto":"How does Bitcoin solve the problem of double-spending?","verso":"Bitcoin solves the problem of double-spending by using a timestamp server."},{"section":"Timestamp Server","recto":"How does the timestamp server work in Bitcoin?","verso":"The timestamp server works by taking a hash of a block of items to be timestamped and widely publishing the hash."},{"section":"Proof-of-Work","recto":"How is the proof-of-work system used in Bitcoin?","verso":"The proof-of-work system is used to implement a distributed timestamp server on a peer-to-peer basis."},{"section":"Network","recto":"What is the incentive for nodes to support the Bitcoin network?","verso":"The incentive for nodes to support the Bitcoin network is the creation of new coins."},{"section":"Incentive","recto":"How is the incentive for nodes to support the Bitcoin network funded?","verso":"The incentive for nodes to support the Bitcoin network can be funded with transaction fees."},{"section":"Reclaiming Disk Space","recto":"How can disk space be reclaimed in Bitcoin?","verso":"Disk space can be reclaimed in Bitcoin by discarding spent transactions."},{"section":"Simplified Payment Verification","recto":"How can a user verify payments without running a full network node in Bitcoin?","verso":"A user can verify payments without running a full network node in Bitcoin by using alerts from network nodes to detect invalid blocks."},{"section":"Combining and Splitting Value","recto":"How can fan-out be used in Bitcoin transactions?","verso":"Fan-out can be used in Bitcoin transactions to avoid the need to extract a complete standalone copy of a transaction's history."},{"section":"Privacy","recto":"How can a new key pair be used for each transaction in Bitcoin?","verso":"A new key pair can be used for each transaction in Bitcoin to keep them from being linked to a common owner."}],"Advanced":[{"section":"Calculations","recto":"What is the probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit in Bitcoin?","verso":"The probability of an attacker catching up from a given deficit in Bitcoin is discussed in the paper using the analogy of a gambler's ruin problem."},{"section":"Calculations","recto":"What is the probability of a recipient of a new transaction needing to wait before being sufficiently certain the sender can't change the transaction in Bitcoin?","verso":"The probability of a recipient of a new transaction needing to wait before being sufficiently certain the sender can't change the transaction in Bitcoin is discussed in the paper."},{"section":"Conclusion","recto":"What is the proposed system for electronic transactions without relying on trust in Bitcoin?","verso":"The proposed system for electronic transactions without relying on trust in Bitcoin is summarized in the paper."},{"section":"Conclusion","recto":"What is the robustness of the Bitcoin system in its unstructured simplicity?","verso":"The robustness of the Bitcoin system in its unstructured simplicity is discussed in the paper."}]}}
